All requests to the api must provide a valid key 

- Access with the api_key is done with a query parameter:

```
- If no api_key is provided the API return error 
```
{

# Endpoints
## Tickets
###  /ticket/checkin/code/{code}
Ticket checking, this endpoint is used to checkin in last2ticket system a ticket with your specific vendor id (external_id) that you use in your platform. 
```
https://api.last2ticket.com/ticket/checkin/code/<YOUR_CODE>?api_key=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

##### Success Response
```
{
  "stt": "OK",
  "message": {
    "external_code": "<YOUR_CODE>",
    "text": "Checkin completed."
  }
}
```

##### Errors
External code not found - this code is not associated with any sold ticket in Last2Ticket platform.
```
{
  "stt": "NOK",
  "message": {
    "external_code": "<YOUR_CODE>",
    "text": "External code not found."
  }
}
```


## Discount codes
Create new discount codes for specific events owned by you. Add and remove events and items to discount codes.

There are specific operations for /PUT /GET and /DELETE for just event_id and event_id + item_id combination. 
This means users can add specific items under an event just like in UX. But removing all event_id + item_id will not create a simple discount->item association like it happens in UX, this is not intuitive in an API. 


Example: User lists records in api_discount_codes_events for discount_1 and gets

```
discount_1 - event_50 - item_1
discount_1 - event_50 - item_2
```

He then removes the 2 items with:
```
DELETE /discount-code/discount_1/event/event_50/item/item_1
DELETE /discount-code/discount_1/event/event_50/item/item_2
```

In the API the result of the following endpoints will be empty,

```
LIST /discount-code/discount_1/events
GET /discount-code/discount_1/event/event_50
```

In the Admin app UX, the result is actually 1 record, because the UX is adding a record for discount_1 - event_50 when all items are removed for an event.
To achieve similar behaviour add the relation explicitly after the 2 deletes: 
```
PUT /discount-code/discount_1/event/event_50
```

### List 
List discount codes for event_id
```
GET /discount-code/list/event/<EVENT_ID>?api_key=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```
Response sample

- **value(*)** : number (max length 8) - Actual discount value (e.g. 5).
- **limit** : number - Number of times this code can be used (e.g. 100 - after 100 usages in checkout the discount will no longer take effect).
- **expires** : date (format - yyyy-mm-dd) - Date until when the discount is valid (e.g. "2023-12-21").
- **active** : boolean - If the discount is active or inactive.
- **event_id(*)** : number - The event to which this discount will apply.
- **item_id** : array[number] - Specific items inside an event (e.g. [10, 20], the discount will apply only to event item 10 and 20). In no items are provided, the discount applies to the whole event_id.
